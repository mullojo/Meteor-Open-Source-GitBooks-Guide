# Introduction

### Options for starting a new GitBook:

1. **Private start, share later**: Make a GitBook from your personal free GitBook account, sync it to your personal GitHub, and then later import the GitBook to this shared Meteor Community library.
2. **Public start, share now**: Make a new GitBook here and sync it with your new personal GitBook repo.

With both of these options, you will get to write in GitBook for productivity benefits and enjoy the great user interface.   You just decide if you want to work on it **privately** or **publicly**.

You can also write markdown elsewhere and import markdown into GitBook, but each page of markdown needs to be imported or copied/pasted into a GitBook page, so it's not the best option if you eventually want to put docs you write into an open source GitBook here. 

### Learning how to use GitBook's amazing UI:

The best place to learn about GitBook is their docs: [https://docs.gitbook.com/getting-started/quick-start](https://docs.gitbook.com/getting-started/quick-start)
