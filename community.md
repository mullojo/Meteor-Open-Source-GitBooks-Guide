# Community

We can actively share what GitBooks we are creating and working on together.  I think this page can serve as an index to books & creators.

We can use GitHub handles to keep track of contributors to start.

| Book Name \(w/ GitBook Link\) | Status | Contributors \(w/ GitHub Link\) | Topics \(Tags\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Meteor Open Source GitBook Guide | WIP | [mullojo](https://github.com/mullojo) | community |
| Vue + Meteor | WIP | [mullojo](https://github.com/mullojo) | vue, beginner |
| Meteor Microservices | WIP | [jankapunkt](https://github.com/jankapunkt) | microservices |
| Discover Meteor | WIP | [SachaG](https://github.com/SachaG) | blaze, mongodb |
| **You're book** | **Idea** | **you** | **anything** |

We'll figure out an easy process to manage permission for contributors that you might like to join in creating your book.  For now an **admin** role it given to the original book creator, and it's probably recommended that people who want to contribute on books are given a **writer** role.
